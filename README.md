### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--

I'm Narendra Soni, an engineer and entrepreneur currently based in Singapore. I am passionate about software development, particularly building large enterprise applications.

If there is one word to define my personality, it would be "curious." I don't see "problems" as roadblocks; rather, they are opportunities to grow and learn.

I have been actively building startups for a while, which has helped me propel my skillset to the next level. In fact, I now have a blueprint that I follow for initiating projects. This blueprint acts as a starter for both the project and its infrastructure. Like other founders, I have learned skills such as product management, business development, technology roadmap creation, technology architecture and development, DevOps, and infrastructure automation.

I hustle hard and tackle everything that comes my way, ensuring the success of my projects.

Some of my recent work includes building:

- A hardware and software project for the early detection of pests in plantations (farms and forests). This project is still in its early days.

- Startup Tech Blueprint: This is a project I improve every time I work on it. It combines Infrastructure as Code (IAC) and bridges Kubernetes add-ons and workload manifests. With one command, my projects go from 0 to 1, allowing me to focus on shipping features in a matter of minutes.

- LetsFlex: "TikTok for long-form text," as my co-founder and I describe it. Search engines and social media are largely driven by SEO, clickbait, and high-domain authority instead of the merits of the content. Users spend endless hours searching, but the best content often doesn't appear. Quality content is usually found in blogs, newsletters, Medium, or Substack articles. We decided to build a TikTok-like platform that ranks long-form texts based on their quality and provides a personalized search and recommendation layer.

- Blockchain Indexer: I built an indexer for EVM chains from scratch. It had four paid customers and it is highly stable and efficient.

I would love to connect with you and discuss more.
